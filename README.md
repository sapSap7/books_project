Project description : 

a virtual "library" where the use can insert book titles and their authors and have it
displayed on the screen as a list. The user has the option to delete the book from the list with
a delete button.

The project is composed of Node.js and React, and css for the styling. 

On the client folder, we will have the React components for each function on the page and a file concentrating them all. (App.jsx).
On the server folder - a .json file to store the inserted books, and a .js file for the node.js code.

Hope you enjoy this project as much as I did ! :)
